# grachtlichtjes

Christmas lights, the nerdy version. A string of neopixels shows _Brians Brain_, a cellular automaton that simulates nerve cells firing. A cell fires if two neighbours fire and lights up red. After firing a cell goes through a resting phase where it cannot fire for one cycle. Resting cells are green.
